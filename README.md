Title:  Meal Generator

Description:
User inputs a list of favorite ingredients or ingredients that they have on hand, webapp produces a suggested recipe(s) to try.

Vision Statement:
Our project’s goal in mind is to give the user an idea of what they can create or make with the ingredients they have on hand. 

Motivation:
There are many instances of individuals not knowing what they can make given a collection of ingredients. They also don’t know how long any meal might take. By giving them a list of an assortment of different combinations of meals, they will make a better use of their time by making the meal that sounds best and in the shortest amount of time. 

Risks:
Don’t know team members skill sets
Little planning of what needs to be done
Don’t know optimization methods
Don’t know what we’ll do for feature engineering

Mitigation Strategy:
Hard work
Planning to meet few times in order to trace out our individual jobs and deadlines
Using the agile environment to be as efficient as possible
